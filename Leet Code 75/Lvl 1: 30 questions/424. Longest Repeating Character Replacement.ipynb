    "#### Explanation\n",
    "Essentially in this sliding window solution, we want to expand our window while updating our result simutaneously until the window is no longer valid. How do we determine whether a window is valid or not? From the premise, we know that the # of characters being switched out cannot be greater than k. So in our window, we are going to take the max value of the # needed to switch out from the group of characters. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "AABA, the maximum # is 3, and 4 - 3 = 1, which is less than 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "So why do we need the maximum value? This takes a bit of inverse thinking, if we take subtract the max value with the length of the window, that prompts us the minimum # of characters needed to switch out.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep track of the maximum frequence, I've created the variable called \"freq\". freq will capture the maximum number of times a character appears by comparing it with the most recently inserted character\n",
    "\n",
    "We could update the maximum size of the subarray by subtracting the right pointer with the left."
